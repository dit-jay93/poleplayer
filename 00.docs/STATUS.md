Current phase: 00 — Project Setup & CI

What’s done
- Initial doc review complete
- Progress tracking initialized

What’s next
- Create Xcode workspace and modular targets
- Define baseline app shell and build/run instructions
- Set up minimal feature flags and crash logging stub
- Add CI build + unit test workflow

Blockers / Risks
- VFR policy decision still open (CODEC_POLICY notes) — needs explicit call
- Precision path for Long-GOP exact seek/step may require careful AVFoundation strategy

What Jay can test right now
- Nothing yet (no app scaffolded)
