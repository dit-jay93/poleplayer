# RnR — PM / PO (Product Manager / Product Owner)
- Scope: V1 MVP delivery and gatekeeping

## Responsibilities
- Own V1 scope boundaries (in-scope / out-of-scope) and keep them stable.
- Maintain roadmap, sprint goals, and acceptance gates.
- Own decision log: format support policy, VFR policy, sidecar policy, distribution policy.
- Run sprint planning/review and keep demo criteria aligned with DoD.
- Manage risks: performance, licensing/SDKs, sandbox/TCC limitations, long-GOP frame accuracy.

## Primary Deliverables
- Updates to: `ROADMAP.md`, `MVP.md`, `DEV_PLAN.md`, `CODEC_POLICY.md`, `BENCHMARK.md`
- Decision log (recommended add): `DECISIONS.md`
- Demo scripts per gate (recommended add): `DEMO_CHECKLIST.md`

## Codex Checklist
- [ ] Confirm V1 supported formats list + user messaging (Supported / Partial / Not supported)
- [ ] Lock the definition of “Precision = ±0 frame” and any explicit exceptions
- [ ] Lock export package requirements (still + notes.json) and naming template
- [ ] Maintain gate criteria (G0–G3) and ensure each sprint ends with a demo pass/fail
- [ ] Keep a running list of known issues with severity and target fix version
